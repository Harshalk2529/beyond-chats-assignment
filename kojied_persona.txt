[Goals, Needs & Wishes]
1. I want to transfer from robinhood, but wb only allows 50k transfers at a time.
2. To have multiple granaries, one close to your berries/deer/fish and one for your veggies/apples/honey.
3. Any tips for photo realism would be appreciated!
4. I'm trying to find ways to diversify the gameplay.
5. To have early on, although you often use them for bulk popping once you have research labs up and running.
